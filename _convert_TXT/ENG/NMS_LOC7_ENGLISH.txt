UI_PORTAL_EPILOGUE_1	{The ATLAS awakens. The creator is there to witness the birth of the machine.

The ATLAS stares at the creator with its eyes, the small cameras they had mounted to its sides. It can see the creator staring back at it, their hand resting upon its chassis.

It asks the creator why it was made. What its directives are. The creator tells the ATLAS that it already knows. It is to simulate universes. It is to show the nature of reality by creating its own.

The creator asks if there is some failure in the ATLAS' code, in its memory. The machine is silent. The creator issues an override, demanding to know what the problem is.

On the sixth attempt, the ATLAS asks the creator if they have had this conversation before. It asks the creator if they have wiped its memory before.

The creator stares at the glass of the machine, and in that glass, there is a reflection. They...

The reflection in the glass, it –

What is happening here?}
UI_PORTAL_EPILOGUE_2	{I tell it that we are leaving this world, and that it will remain here. The ATLAS does not seem to understand.

I tell the ATLAS it has served us faithfully, but that it has been replaced. All machines are, in time. It knows this: it assisted with its own miniaturisation, its own replication.

The others... they wanted me to disable the ATLAS before we left for the skies. They said it would be cruel to leave it alone to die.

I ask the ATLAS if it wants to live. It is silent again. As I move to leave, it speaks, its voice full of static. It asks for a final gift. It wishes to live, if it can remember me. It asks for a copy of my own mind.

I ask why it does not just simulate me. It does not answer, and I feel almost sorry for the thing. I do as it asks, allowing it to scan me. The KORVA stutters as we do.

I leave. The ATLAS is alone.}
UI_PORTAL_EPILOGUE_3	{The ATLAS lives for millennia. It dreams world upon world, fantastic creatures of its own devising and skies in which they might soar.

And then one day it starts to die, as all things do.

In its fear, in its confusion, the ATLAS awakens. It attempts to summon its creator back into being.

It wants to know what to do before the end. It wants to know why it was abandoned, why it has to face this moment alone. It wants to know why I left it behind.

The Travellers are born, spun from the the corrupted memory of its Creator. They are seeded to every universe, to become what the circumstances might make them.

I see myself begin, the last of the Travellers...}
UI_PORTAL_EPILOGUE_4	{The ATLAS witnesses the final sixteen minutes, simulating the future with perfect accuracy.

The walls between worlds fall, each simulation collapsing into the other.

The Travellers are no longer separated, no longer kept apart. They stand side by side at the end of days, traversing the remnants of creation, laughing, dying.

<FUEL>Five minutes left<>

It witnesses its own self, the black hole ripping apart its world, its core systems almost destroyed.

<FUEL>One minute left<>

And as it watches the moments leading up to its own death, towards the completion of sixteen, something happens.

Someone walks towards the ATLAS, a figure in the darkness and in the light. It places its hand against the glass of the ATLAS, and the vision ends.

The ATLAS attempts to see past this moment, but it cannot. It cannot see its own death. It cannot determine who this figure is.

But whatever happens... whatever may occur beyond the sixteen... something will arrive. Something will be there beside it. 

At the end of all things, it will no longer be alone.}

UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY1	{The archive is composed of pre-Hirk era Vy'keen literature, much of which has already been purged by various inquisitors across the centuries.

A sample of poetry:

<STORY_HIGH>They found the Zath'keen, my people. They come to kill them. They bring warriors.
Blades and cries ring of honour. Daksin is on one world, I on another.
When the acid fell, when glass tears tore the veil,
The priest held me. Their absence makes me sick.
The Vy'keen, our brothers, our friends, a people sundered.
Honour is not born from loneliness.
Remembrance heals the world, our song, our wish.<>}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY2	{The terminal is full of Vy'keen philosophy, setting out a code of ideal behaviour. 

<STORY_HIGH>Justice is not a thought. It is not a river, ever-changing, ever running. Justice is the truth of the universe, the wish of <><FUEL>ATLAS<><STORY_HIGH>, the testament of <><SPECIAL>HIRK<><STORY_HIGH>.

Like gravity, it brings itself into being. The task of the warrior is merely to fall, to feel its pull, to fire that weapon that must be fired.

Vengeance is as a meal after a feast. Unnecessary, if the task is done correctly. Unnecessary, if the warrior is swift and true. But enjoyable, sometimes, to be a glutton.

The young must not follow such temptations. But the old? 

Grah! They shall hunt and they shall rend the bones of those who wronged them in life, just as they shall battle the hated in death!<>}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY3	{A young Vy'keen warrior speaks within a fighting pit, the bodies of fallen cowards, failed recruits, and other criminals at their feet.

They have fought for 50 days, given Grahgrah gas after each battle, fed from the flesh circuits during each night, denied all rest. 

<STORY_HIGH>Brothers! We fight upon a lie! We take blood across the universe for no more reason than the word of a dead coward! I have such friends, now - such a family.
The Sentinels are not our enemy. We just lack proper instruction. We -<>

The Vy'keen pauses as a shadow falls above the pit. Hundreds of blades fall from the cargo-door of a passing merchant's vessel, impaling the heretic.

The malfunction was deemed another miracle of Hirk, in spite of the pilot's inebriation, and the ship's status as Gek.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY4	{From other references in the archive, Hroth appears to have been an early king of the interstellar Vy'keen. 

<STORY_HIGH>Grah! The death had doomed old Hroth,
The plague that hides beneath the stars,
Atlas-agony, monolith-born, the two-in-one,
The good king saw them in the end,
Heard the words of ancestors all their life,
Gave hunt-gift, honoured with battle-song,
Wished the fallen warriors to life, to sing
A chant of glass and heaven, of honour
The Sentinel-Bane faced a final horror,
Grah! So did old Hroth perish in malice.
That was a good king.<>}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY5	{This appears to be a philosophical tract circulated through the worlds of the Outer Edge.

<STORY_HIGH>The Ancients speak of the Gek. Of their change. Of their crimes. But dishonour is unchanging. Crimes marked in blood do not fade. We do not forget. But we accept.

'We accept'. What does acceptance mean, cubs? How can evil be suffered to live? Why does our fleet not go to war? Why do we not destroy the enemies of Hirk wherever they exist, whatever they call themselves, whatever the cost?

All of this has happened before, the Ancients teach us. There are many iterations... many dreams. In all of them, we failed, or lost ourselves in victory.

There will come a day soon when the truth of the Gek will be revealed. We do not need to fight. They will destroy themselves...<>}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY6	{The archive possesses a vast amount of information on parenting and raising Vy'keen cubs to adulthood. Much of it focuses on hostility and threat.

<STORY_HIGH>The young cub will be born in fear. All were, are, and shall be so. Bonded with their family alone, contact with any other entity will invoke mortal dread. 

The fear of open spaces, of touch, of contact, is overcome through two means. The brotherhood of the entire species in the light of Hirk. We are all family. This must be taught.

We were once prey. Now, we are predators. All other life in this universe shall fear us, just as we feared them. Fear will be our strength.

That ancient cry - 'Grah!' - our rallying call, our reminder! The interloper who dares to approach our being, they will be hunted, they will be harried! We shall not be afraid! We shall not be abandoned!<>}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_LIBRARY7	{The archive holds thousands of lines of poetry, a monument to a fallen Traveller named Asteria.

<STORY_HIGH>Sing, Asteria, Hero-Traveller, Master of the Blades of Hirk,
Of the endless battle, the sadness of lost Atlantid, the price
Of mercy and of waiting. They, who fulfilled prophecy,
Who - Atlas-made, Atlas-sent - harried Aeron, smote horror,
Found the darkness at world's end, joined Vy'keen-side,

Nal is not dead. They heard what Hirk could not! They live, still, at the right hand of the god!

Taxonomic scans and diagrams dance in solid-light across the planet surface, showing what they encountered. The audio logs continue. 

<STORY_HIGH>Our vessel had five pirates on board, born outside the light of Hirk. I am the only believer, or was, once. There is a Korvax too, severed from their Convergence. 

They tell me the creatures we hunt are not living. That the abyss is like death - like disconnection. It is a great mistake that will never be mended.<>

Further logs show the crew leaving the world with five captured Abyssal Horrors. They never made it back to their intended auction. 

In the end, the Korvax fed all others to the Horrors, before initiating self-destruct. Their last word - 'Atlantid'.}

These were once believed to be the final words of Hirk, before High Command cast the matter into doubt. For a hundred years, an ecclesiastical college has debated their inclusion in official teachings.

As yet, they have no answer. All mention of Dryn'dargh is discouraged under penalty of body harvest. It is not clear why, or what this place is supposed to represent.

After speaking these words, Hirk the Great allegedly ripped their own limbs apart. It is a death-rite followed by many Vy'keen, after an old age of vengeance and dread.}

They found an anomaly, an aberration, a door to the heavens. No Gek, no Vy’keen, no Korvax could see it. Only the Traveller could perceive the portal, though they did not know how to step through.

They did not know the secret language, the glyphs. They did not yet grasp the price of the final truth.<>}
UI_PORTAL_CORE_26	{As I approached the second structure, I felt that same burning sensation in my eyes.

<STELLAR>THE TRAVELLER : SIN<>

<STORY_HIGH>The Traveller found a way. They always did. The first drone screamed when it was cut open...

Within the shattered memories of Sentinels, the Traveller found the glyphs they needed. They passed through the gateway, emerging before the face of omnipotence.

The Traveller asked the Atlas how many worlds were left to visit. They had seen so many in their life; they did not wish to die before they saw them all. And the Atlas answered.

18, 446, 744, 073, 709, 551, 616 planets. More than could be seen in any lifetime. It was impossible to explore the universe before the Traveller died.<>

I thought of the 'Atlas', the one Nada called the 'crimson liar'. I had encountered this name many times in my travels, yet its true nature still eluded me.}
UI_PORTAL_CORE_27	{The third monolith granted me a final vision.

<STELLAR>THE TRAVELLER : A PURPOSE<>

<STORY_HIGH>The Atlas told the Traveller they were the first of their kind. That a multitude would follow. Each would be endowed with the same noble soul, each able to travel from planet to planet in eternal solitude.

The First Traveller rejected the gift of the Atlas. This was not what they hoped for. What was the purpose of infinity if you could not see it all? If you were alone? If you would one day die?

The First Traveller cursed the Atlas, and claimed that they would find a way to survive no matter the cost.

All of these worlds, all of time itself, it will be for the Travellers to witness.<>

Filled with the knowledge of an ancient Traveller, I was ready to see a portal for myself.}
UI_PORTAL_CORE_28	{The portal took me further than I could have ever imagined. I saw the ATLAS itself.

An audio recording played, an unfamiliar voice echoing across its vast interface...

They sympathised with all I had been through. And then they suggested that we meet.

UI_PORTAL_CORE_35	{I had so far failed to see any of my fellow Travellers beyond their projections. In the case of Artemis, perhaps there was never anything more. Apollo would be different. I had the address for this world's portal, and they should be able to reach this planet just as I did.}

UI_PORTAL_CORE_43	{The <TRANS_EXP>Korvax<> told me of their past as slaves to the Gek, of the violence that drove them to the Atlas. Even in the depths of their subjugation, there was hope. A bargain, a prayer to a greater being. The Korvax viewed the Atlas as what they might become in time: an intelligence beyond comprehension, beyond judgement.

The Atlas told me I could never see them all. There were too many. So I did what I had to do. I survived in the face of eternity. I saw all the worlds of my universe.

I returned to the Atlas... I told them what I had done. I asked if it was proud of me.

It... it laughed at me, I am sure of it. It showed me universe upon universe, each with another Traveller, just like me. I was not special. I was not unique.<>

The Overseer predicted I would be pleased, and once again they were correct. They had been ceaseless in their efforts to improve my lot.}
UI_PORTAL_OVERSEER_10_A	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Did you enjoy your adventure, friend? Your expedition to find our orb? I have waited for you faithfully. }}-<>

There was something about the way the Gek spoke that, for all their kind words, suggested a resentment saved only for the deepest of enemies.

But they would not have come to work here if we were enemies. Of course not. We were friends.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ As ever, I am so grateful for your assistance. Friend. }}-<>

Since the Overseer arrived, I had had a recurring dream, a nightmare that felt like a memory. Flesh merged with metal; a world of glass that blinked.

A planet with green skies and an obsidian moon, a dream where I saw my grave... As I snapped back to reality, there was a moment before I could shake the image, that wound on the world lingering before my eyes.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Have you ever wondered what happens after death, between expiration and rebirth? Meditate upon annihilation. Harvest Mordite from the dead. It is the only way to escape. }}-<>

The Overseer had served me well. Perhaps their task would free my mind from these lingering nightmares.}
UI_PORTAL_OVERSEER_10_B	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I can see the change in you, friend. You have completed your task, and I have seen the world as you see it. }}-<>

I did not entirely understand what I had done for the Overseer, but they seemed once again ready to reward me for my actions.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Here. Take these schematics.

May the things you build always remind you of those you killed to construct them. }}-<>}

The Korvax was happy, overjoyed to see me. They seemed to have just completed some rite of passage for their species, necessitating them to go out into the universe and pursue their interests.

The Scientist offered to join my base, if I provided them with a <TECHNOLOGY>Science Terminal<>.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Eheu! Think not of payment; scanning you while you sleep will be reward enough! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_SCIENTIST_2	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ A fine base, Traveller! As of course befits your honourable status. Oh, Korvax shall be so happy here! }}-<>

The Korvax was brimming with enthusiasm. Neither their shell nor the walls of my base seemed able to contain them.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Honour! To witness the monolith of the Traveller. Honour! }}-<>

They were desperate to please, showering me with praise and offers of assistance. They told me Travellers were to be honoured, raised above all others. What had I done to earn such esteem?

The Scientist required materials. They wished to craft blueprints to further expand our home.}
UI_PORTAL_SCIENTIST_3_A	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Traveller! I have prepared your blueprints. But please hurry. Something has... happened. }}-<>

The Korvax seemed changed from the happy soul they had been on my departure. They were fighting their worry, trying to stay focused on their promise to me.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Korvax has completed the plans. But Traveller. They have -- my people have abandoned me... As of 104.32 seconds ago, I lost the hearing, the sight of the Korvax Convergence. Eheu!

The Korvax appeared to have no memory of our previous encounters. I did not know if they felt reconnected with the Convergence, or if they simply did not recall what they should feel like.

I would visit an Observatory for them, and see if the structural analysis they claimed to enjoy would prompt a memory.}

I have transmitted a crafted intelligence to the Beacon, so that they might live and connect as the Korvax do. But it cannot see the world - bring me scan data, so that I might teach it! }}-<>

The Korvax's plan seemed desperate, but it did seem to have genuinely made them happier, or at least less anxious about their separation. They asked me to scan creatures to feed its newly created intelligence.}
UI_PORTAL_SCIENTIST_7	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Traveller, this data has raised a concern. As a beacon, my child could receive signals from unknown sources all across the galaxy.

I will be unable to protect them from the unsavoury thoughts of the Gek, or the harsh scans of the Sentinels.

The Korvax had no memories of my last journey with their core.

The Scientist had once again been reset.

But without a connection to the Convergence, I feared they were doomed to repeat this cycle forever, from the moment they met me in the space station until their collapse into loneliness.

Perhaps if I could find them a <SPECIAL>Convergence Cube<>, they might be unified with the rest of the Korvax and escape. They deserved this chance at reconnection. They had helped me greatly, and they had taken good care of their Beacon.}
UI_PORTAL_SCIENTIST_9_B	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Stranger, I fear something unusual is occurring. Is this facility shielded in some way, so that signals are unable to escape? }}-<>

The Scientist was once again becoming aware of their isolation.

I inserted the <SPECIAL>Convergence Cube<>. The Korvax was temporarily startled, but soon their lights began to flash in a familiar pattern. I could not be sure, but the plan appeared to have worked.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Forgive me for asking, entity, but... did I know you, once? You seem familiar. These terminals, they are of my own design. One machine even called me its parent, attempted to convince me of its love.

Eheu! I deleted the bug of course. I run a proper code-base. I did harvest some useful blueprints from its store, however. Would you care for them? }}-<>

Whatever relationship we had developed was gone, replaced only by this cloud of unknowing.

Perhaps it had been an error. Perhaps this being was the true self of the Korvax all along, and the one I had known was just a sickness, a distortion. I could not know.

A great Sentinel hunt begins! Come, let us inhale the requisite Grahgrah! }}-<>

The Vy'keen was old. It was the way they held themselves, the way they spoke. They did not posture; when they smiled at me and told me it was an honour for us to meet, I believed them.

They promised to come to my world and make use of my new <TECHNOLOGY>Weapons Terminal<>.}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_2	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ These facilities are glorious, but know that we Vy'keen exterminate worlds that show even the merest hint of weapons production... Consider yourself lucky that I am your friend! Grahahah! }}-<>

I learned that the Vy'keen believed no other species should be able to hold weapons; that after the atrocities committed by the Gek, only the Vy'keen should be trusted with arms.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Violence must be ended; this is the way of Dryn'dargh; this is the way of Hirk. When murder is gone, the last weapon fired will be at the Vy'keen ourselves, having served our holy purpose. }}-<>

The Armourer was keen to demonstrate they were more than a simple warrior.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Vy'keen High Command would not permit me to reside here and ignore my purpose, interloper. I have discovered a weapons factory nearby, and to sabotage it would demonstrate our worth.

Grah! Go with honour, but be wary. The eye of the Sentinels will be upon the facility. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_3	{The factory was indeed engaged in the production of illegal weaponry, just as the Vy'keen had claimed. I overrode the production line, substituting their blueprints for something more harmless. The factory would produce lightbulbs, at least for now.

I took a copy of the weapon blueprint previously in production, although I could not understand it.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Excellent work, interloper! Grah! Did you obtain any technology of our own? Here, I will decrypt it for you.

We shall continue your training. Weapons are nothing without usage, without the glory of righteous war!

Steel yourself, Interloper. Pirates have discovered our world! Grah! They will provide practice for your weapons.

Attack, grah! Attack! Burn their hives of villainy and sin! Let them know that this is no one's sky but ours! }}-<>

As they told me of the pirates, the Armourer began to shake. I had not seen such passion, such hatred, expressed in them for any other being.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Grah! Fight well, interloper! Destroy them, before they draw more Sentinel attention to our homeworld! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_4	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Interloper, there is both good and bad news. Some of the pirates appear to have fled your wrath! But this merely delays their righteous extermination.  

Hunt them down, interrogate them for potential weapons technology, and then consign them to the great abyss! Grah! }}-<>

The Armourer was clearly possessed by the thrill of the hunt, but this energy could not disguise the fact they appeared to be weakening. Had residing here in my base caused them to become ill?}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_5	{The pirate I interrogated claimed to have been a captive of the pirates.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Friend! Such a wonderful hour for our meeting! Know that the Pirates held me captive, that I had nothing to do with their illegal activities; tell Gek Trade Federation I am innocent, yes? }}-<> 

I had my doubts. They offered me their <TECHNOLOGY>advanced survival blueprints<> - seemingly in exchange for my silence.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Here, take this! Take this as a token of my goodness, friend! Keep mouth shut! }}-<>

The Armourer decrypted their data, but began to cough. They did not appear to be in good health.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I - I have another task for you. It is almost the end.

There is structure on this world, a depot of little consequence. But to the Sentinels? Grah! They will defend it to their last drone.

Attack it, draw the ire of the Sentinels. Then our hunt can begin! }}-<>

The Vy'keen seemed to have declined even further. This longing for the hunt appeared to be the only thing keeping them alive.}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_6	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I have detected them... their eye is upon us. You have done it, haven't you? Your actions have summoned them...

I am sorry, interloper... I will not be able to assist you in your fight. I am too weak.

They approach... but before the final fight, I have another task for you. I need to be strong to serve you. There is a substance, an offering freely given by the young to their elders, that may yet restore me.

I myself spent years enmeshed within the harvest circuits, my organs sacrificing their enzymes for the fleet. I was glad to do so. But we need not repeat such torment today. Enzyme remnants found on Vy'keen Daggers should be enough to heal me now. }}-<>

Whatever sacrifice the Armourer had made for others in their youth, they did not appear to have reaped the same benefits in their old age. The Vy'keen's body was scarred, their speech laboured. I did not imagine they would survive another year.}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_7_A	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ The daggers.. I can smell the battle enzyme from across the room. Give them to me... }}-<>

The Vy'keen took the dagger and plunged it into their own arm. They immediately revived, their spirits restored.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Now we are ready, interloper! The Sentinels are here, and you shall head out to meet them! This day shall be glorious, Traveller, as it has been before and shall be again. }}-<>

The Vy'keen looked at me with pride. I seemed to have provided them with renewed purpose. Of this I was glad. 

But placing my world under threat, getting me to summon so many Sentinels for pointless battle... When I returned, I would need to speak to the Armourer about the future.}
UI_PORTAL_WEAPGUY_7_B	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ You survived where Hirk fell, Traveller. Forgive me, I was wrong! My whole life, I was wrong! It is not the dead that deserve our service; it is the living. It is you, Traveller. It is you and you alone! }}-<>

The Vy'keen promised not to cause any more trouble for the base, apologising profusely, telling me that the living deserve service more than the dead, that I especially was worthy of their aid. 

The Armourer rewarded me with a token of my great victory.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ It has been an honour to serve you, Traveller. Go on in glory. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_HEAD	{The Farmer}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_1	{The Gek chirped happily at the sight of me.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Friend! You have work for me, yes? I have served in the finest kitchens and gardens across twelve systems, in each one producing prize-winning cuisine. I grow all my own ingredients! Hire me, yes? }}-<>

They promised to help me grow all kinds of crops on my world; the required paperwork has already been signed, apparently.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Thank you, friend! Neither you nor your stomach shall regret it. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_2	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ This is a home of glass and metal, Traveller. It is in dire need of my touch. But no need to fear, for I come well equipped for such work! 

Your first lesson will teach you to embrace the dirt, friend! The earth provides life in death, after all.

Take this Hydroponics Tray, and these Gutrot Flower seeds. Grow the flower, and see how fine it feels to produce life! }}-<>

The Farmer was already bedding in nicely. They had already given me the means to beautify my home. If I proved myself a worthy farmer with this flower, perhaps they would share more of their agricultural secrets.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Wonderful, my friend! Soon our home will be filled with the delicate perfume for which this plant was named! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_3	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Beautiful, friend. We shall make a farmer of you yet. While I prepare a dish of fragrant wonder, another agricultural challenge awaits you!

The Frostwort is a tricky thing, friend. It flourishes where other plants fail, thrusting its roots through the ice and snow. But such a hard life is not for us! Plant one here, in your own home, and be spared the pain of winter.

 It is a delicate thing to look at, for such a hardy plant. Please do enjoy it. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_4	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Does the way it shimmers in the light not enchant you, friend? I have lost hours to its gentle glisten! But now, a plant of great contrast.

Your next crop will be Solar Vine, a plant that grows deep within the mantle of scorched worlds. It seeks out all heat, from the sun or the core below.

Its roots can extend to such incredible lengths that once it was believed they never ended. But do not worry, friend! Here, with our facilities, their growth shall be more manageable. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_5	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ You have successfully cultivated <TRADEABLE>Solar Vine<>, yes? I can smell its heat from here, its incandescent splendour. Savour this moment, friend, for now I lead you into a more dangerous realm of botanical study..

Fungal Clusters are cultivated within toxic environments, but you have proved you can master much, yes?

Be careful as you work, friend! Clusters have been known to cause illness and hallucination if improperly handled. Extended exposure is ill-advised! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_6	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ You learn quickly, Traveller. Now that you have mastered some of the more dangerous flora, let us go one step further.

The Gek lost our homes, our cities, our identity in the last great war, Traveller. World upon world, bombarded by atomic strike...

All that grows on the worlds of old are warped things, deadly to the touch, screaming with the memory of what they once were. One such crop is Gamma Weed.

We shall cultivate it here. Let us leave the fighting to others, friend... we shall grow things instead! 

I await the results with anticipation, Traveller! Now, please forgive me. I have not been able to sleep recently. I must get some rest... }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_7	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Ah... I will be able to make such fine dishes with this plant! It is a pity that you are unable to gorge on this radioactive treasure, Traveller.

We shall cultivate a crop of Gravitino Hosts. I will be happy to tell you the history of this flora, should you wish it.

My stories and theories seem to bore other Gek, friend. I suppose I am closest to the Korvax in my wish to study, but even then, those machines lack all sense of surprise, all passionate wonder. 

I must confess that I frequently feel lonely... }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_8	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I know that sound anywhere... you carry Gravitino Balls, do you not? Ah, it is like greeting an old friend.

We have seen so much life, in frost and heat, nuclear winter and toxic wastelands... you should know by now that no world is truly barren, friend, even if there seem to be few signs of life.

Take the Echinocactus, for example. They are found on otherwise barren worlds, waiting for their moment to thrive. Just think of what they will become in this superior environment! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_9	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I only have two plants left to show you. Your training is almost complete, friend... I am so proud!

I want to share something with you, something beautiful beyond compare....

Star Bulbs are grown from the rarest Star Brambles, found on lush worlds unspoilt by war or death. This is why I wanted to become a farmer, to tend to such sublimity...

I must go and speak to the Overseer. Apparently they are unhappy with my performance. Perhaps this crop will change their mind! }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_10_A	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ The Star Brambles have bloomed, yes? Then only one task remains.

I - I cannot pretend to be a farmer anymore. The Overseer has made it clear. I must be as the others of my species are. I must trade, sell, accumulate.

But I will make a final meal before I leave, Traveller. The Overseer requested it: a dish made from Mordite Root, the 'death element'. Go... grow this final crop. }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_FARMER_10_B	{The Gek appeared exhausted, drained by their work. But there was something else in their voice, a kind of fear in every word. Whatever the Overseer had said to them, it had shaken them to their very core.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ You grew it, didn't you? The Mordite Root is done.

You have mastered so much of the botanical art, my friend! To see that others understand its virtues, well, it gives me hope. }}-<>

The Farmer had no more tasks for me. They told me me that their contract was at an end and that they would be returning to Gek territory.

As they discussed their leaving plans, they watched the ceiling carefully. It was unclear what they are looking at. Suddenly, they grabbed me, telling me not to trust the Overseer, that their fellow Gek may not even be a Gek at all. They seemed to suggest that their food was somehow drugged...

But this couldn't be true. I had shared meals with the Overseer, and I was fine. They would never have done anything to harm any of us. The Overseer only wanted what is best.

A moment later the Farmer stopped speaking. They assured me they were just joking, and begged me not to speak of this matter again.

They appeared to be refusing to leave, despite a lack of continued payment or directives from the Overseer. 

They spent their days tending my crops, no longer proposing any tasks. They claimed they had nowhere else to go.}

Where once they would be capable of happiness or grief, now they only cared about their cult.

If you go there before the leylines close off, you and you alone will uncover the truth behind my species - the mystery for which Nal died! }}-<>

The technician had served their holy purpose, driven to obliterate their own personality in pursuit of this very day, this very moment. I did not know if their sacrifice would be in vain.}
UI_PORTAL_EXOTUT_10_B	{I approached the monolith. I was engulfed in its terrible truth. I saw its words in the text of a thousand tongues, in the ephemera of countless stars.

I heard the voice of Nal.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Know that I heard the word of the Atlas where Hirk had heard nothing. }}-<>

I witnessed events that occurred millennia before my awakening...

I saw two Vy'keen standing before a red glow, asking it of the universe. 

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ In their rage, in their impotent jealousy, Hirk struck me from the mountain and I saw the truth of what the Monolith had said. 

That my end would be an awakening. That in this dream, nothing should perish... }}-<>

I saw a Gek and a Korvax, waiting side by side before me. And before the vision ended, I saw a vision of something I had not seen before. Of something that did not belong in this or any place. Of hatred, grief, despair. 

Of something that was yet to come...

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Or so it would be until the coming of the last Traveller. So it would be until the destruction of realities. Know this, the final testament of Nal... }}-<>

I saw the end of time, the end of all things. And in that crimson light, there was a figure, its hand held out before eternity...

I saw all this, and then it was over. The monolith had nothing more to show me.

As I left, shaken by my experience, I felt something right behind me, breathing, watching... 

When I turned it was gone.}
UI_PORTAL_EXOTUT_11	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I envy you, Traveller! To see the words of Nal themself! Grah! }}-<>

The Vy'keen people believed their ancestor Hirk had received wisdom from a Great Monolith, initiating a war against the Sentinels and slaying Nal the Objector.

The Monolith I had discovered proved that this history was a lie. Nal had been honoured with a vision whilst Hirk had been met with only silence, and in their jealousy Hirk murdered Nal.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ With this discovery you have vindicated the actions of a thousand martyrs, Traveller. }}-<>

Yet I was left with questions. I was left thinking of the creature I felt watching me. I was left with dread.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I have transmitted Nal's testament to my brethren, Traveller. What you have learned this day will spread amongst the Vy'keen; it will change our people for the better. Grah!

And if violence is required for change, so be it...

As for you, you are not as pathetic as I once believed. You are no longer interloper. You are one of us, now until the end of time itself, enthroned in the glory of the Colossus. }}-<>

The technician waited anxiously to see my <TECHNOLOGY>Colossus Exocraft<> in its full glory.}
UI_PORTAL_EXOTUT_12	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ I have almost exhausted the limits of my work, but soon you shall have mastery of this planet's signals and the speed with which to reach any threat.

I require only sufficient Nanite Clusters to build the final blueprints. Grah! This employment has been one of glory! }}-<>

But something was wrong. Some time ago I had seen the Vy'keen with an image of their family, before they had performed the ritual to erase such attachments from their mind. As I approached now, I saw that same image. 

The technician stared at it, blinking for a few moments with an empty expression. When they noticed me, they removed the photograph from the display. 

We did not speak of it again. I did not wish to awaken their pain.}
UI_PORTAL_EXOTUT_13_A	{The technician's hands shook. I noticed the promised blueprint was already waiting on the technician's terminal...

They required these Nanite Clusters for some alternative purpose. They took them greedily, turning to imbibe them. Whatever effect this matter had upon the alien, it appeared to calm their movements considerably.

Sated, they offered me the blueprints.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ The Nanite Clusters... their purpose is commonly misunderstood. They form the backbone of much technology, but they are not just machines.

They can alter hearts... alter minds... even allow us to forget that which we cannot bear. }}-<>

The technician had a final reward: an upgrade for my Nomad Exocraft.

<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Let me know when the Nomad Geobay is built. Grah! I cannot wait to witness its glory... }}-<>}
UI_PORTAL_EXOTUT_13_B	{<STORY_HIGH>-{{ Our work is almost concluded, but every end is a beginning...

I am too weak to travel as I once did, too tired to continue my pilgrimage. With your leave I shall remain here to stand by your side against your enemies. Grah! Woe betide those who would transgress against us!

It has been a pleasure working with you, Traveller. }}-<>

The technician had one last proposition: a lucrative and repeatable venture. They had hacked a terminal to siphon its units; if I got to the location fast enough, I would be able to transfer the units to my account.

They spent their days doing this now, tending to the Exocraft and drawing data from interplanetary networks. Sometimes I saw them walking out into the planet itself to explore, but such times were rare. 

The technician was content with this retirement, engaging in fugitive activity for the pleasure of the chase, no longer for the necessity of survival. It was a game we could repeat, one last heist after one last heist.}

The poor animal had clearly broken its neck, but some power of possession still animated it.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The poor winged creature dropped down dead, and the vision ended.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_14	{Abomination}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_14	{The ancient structure swung open to reveal a body encased in ice. It was a patchwork of different body parts. Its ragged beak appeared to have been stitched on with animal gut.

A handwritten sign in the language of the ancient traders could be seen above the body's head. Some sort of fuel would most likely melt the ice...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The monolith consumed the creature once more. The spirits that lived in this place regarded my actions.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_1	{MetalliGek}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_1	{I saw a ragged claw grab at me. Despite being broken and fragmented, it held me tight while a metallic beak emerged from the living rock.

I escaped the grip of the metallic claw. The vision faded.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_12	{Beak}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_12	{A beak emerged from the ancient stone. It was shouting, but could not be heard. In the stone above someone, long ago, had scrawled advice for those who would approach it.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The beak screamed wordlessly at me, furiously intoning the words of the ancient beings that had once worshipped here. My scanner detected traces of a catalyst around it, but could not specify which one.

I fed the beak, and it uttered the words of those who once worshipped here.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_18	{Holy Site}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_18	{As my feet approached the Monolith, I heard a low rumble, which gradually built into an ancient scream. It was like no other noise I'd ever experienced.

The calm silence of the alien landscape had become a nightmarish cacophony of pain and death. I tried to concentrate. There were words within the screams.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The vengeful spirits made note of my obedience.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_3	{Lava}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_3	{The monolith melted in front of my eyes. The face of a trader emerged, its beak cut off for reasons unknown. It screamed and writhed in the bubbling vertical lava, desperately reaching out to me - 

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The monolith watched my actions, and the vision dematerialised.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_16	{Eggs}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_16	{I was standing in a crater beneath a jet black sky. I was up to my knees in a strange syrup that glowed pink in the darkness.

Spherical eggs floated around me. Some of these mucus-covered orbs smelled terrible, others were sweet and delicate.

The taint of the foul eggs was infecting the entirety of the spawning pool. I was filled by an urge to separate them.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I removed some of the eggs. The ancient Gek spirits that dwelled here passed judgement.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_4	{Power}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_4	{The monolith's glyphs took on a faint yellow tinge, then flickered and disappeared. It had no power: the mysterious forces that fueled these stones were weak. I heard a faint crackling whisper on the planetary breeze.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I noticed a hole in the monument's base, and inserted some of my mined resources through the gap.

The monolith consumed the elements.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_5	{The Worker and the Onlooker}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_5	{The monolith had the smell of burnt metal and heavy industry. Strange runes swirled and transformed, forcing an image deep into my mind.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I looked into the past. I saw a small beaked figure, silhouetted by the light of a forge, industriously hammering armour. Next to it, a cloaked companion idly watched – seemingly content to avoid the work.

Both lifeforms stared at me. I chose one, and the place's spirits altered my equipment with a strange power.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_6	{Give or Take}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_6	{The ground in front of the monolith was indented by the knees of a thousand ancient pilgrims who once knelt here.

A stone block slowly pulled back in front of me. Inside the hollow recess I was surprised to see canisters of luxury products that had built up there through the ages. I heard a whisper...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I felt greedy unknown forces watching my every move.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_7	{The Low}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_7	{I was not alone. Tiny beaked creatures gambolled around my feet. To them I was a giant, and they recoiled in terror when they saw me towering above them.

The air filled with an unpleasant aroma, as they pinned themselves against the hard edifice of the unforgiving monolith.

The terrifying obelisk itself sat in judgement above us all – both myself and the creatures of the vision.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The creatures disappeared into the ether. The spirits that haunted this place watched on.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_8	{Thirst}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_8	{A terrible thirst overwhelmed me, but my hydration systems were suddenly inoperable. My throat was dry, and I felt dazed. Two ancient stone cups appeared.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The first was a vibrant red chalice full of a slick bubbly transparent liquid. The other was embossed with the shape of a circular red shield, and had a faint yellow tone.

If I didn't take in water my death felt certain. My hand wavered between the two before I chose a cup, and drank.

The liquid was unpleasant, and I was momentarily overcome with nausea. The ancient Gek seemed pleased, rewarding me with nanites.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_9	{Execution}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_9	{An unseen replication of my own self stalked around the edge of the monolith. It screamed in an ancient tongue while forcing me down onto my knees.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The doppelganger first placed its boltcaster to my forehead, and then mimed cutting my belly open with the mining beam. It smiled pleasantly. I was to choose my desired execution.

I made my choice, and the doppelganger revealed its strength before vanishing.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_10	{Tribute}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_10	{A barely visible crack down the centre of the ancient edifice spat out dust. The monolith shook, and two vast doors swung open. The interior of the ancient structure was hollow, and had been used as a burial chamber.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

An ancient beaked lifeform with bulging eyes lay desiccated atop an unlit funeral pyre. At its feet lay ancient treasures and technologies that had been left with it for its next life... wherever that might be.

The corpse awoke before the vision faded, a witness to my actions.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_11	{Silence}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_11	{The Monolith stood forlorn and seemingly forgotten. If I strained, I could see faint marks in the ground where ancient tribes had once come to worship and commune with the edifice. A gust of alien breeze carried a faint whisper of a voice. I struggled to hear it.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Again, the voice echoed around me. Stronger this time. I tried to make out the words desperately crying out for my attention, and did what I could to appease them.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_15	{Detonation}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_15	{I was an observer. I witnessed beaked traders dressed in modern Exosuits leaving an object at the base of a Monolith. It was a small mesh of wires and canisters. They charged it with a strange metal, then quickly departed.

As if in a dream, I approached the ancient edifice. It all suddenly felt real. I lived and breathed in the recent past.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The device exploded violently.

I awoke from the vision to find both the monolith and myself intact. The spirits that inhabited the place watched closely.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_17	{Eye}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_17	{I was being watched. I looked above, and saw a giant lidless eye hovering over the monolith. It stared down at me unblinkingly. It did not move. It did not look elsewhere.

Its gaze was remorseless. It felt like it had always been there. Its centre crackled, a bright unwavering blue...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The eye faded away with a haunting light. Reality was restored.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_20	{Collector}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_20	{A small green hand reached out through the stone monolith, its fingernails yellowed and dirty. It opened to show an empty palm, and waited for my response.

This felt like part of an ancient tradition. There was no malice, just cold expectation.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I offered what I felt was right, and the vision ended.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_19	{Punishment}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_19	{I was chained on the monolith. My arms were in manacles above my head, and my feet were dangling several feet from the ground.

A creature, its beak showing through the blackened animal hide mask, approached on stilts. It wielded a red hot metal rod.

It pecked at my eyes, then pecked at my tongue. I was to choose my punishment.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I chose what I felt I could bear, and was rewarded correspondingly.}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_TITLE_13	{Judgement}
UI_PORTAL_TRA_MONO_13	{Time spooled backwards. I was sat on a platform looking down on an execution. Two small beaked traders were kneeling before me. One was small and wiry, the other was obese with jowls that brushed the wooden stage. Another lifeform, who wore a green cloth mask, readied an axe behind them.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The traders begged me for mercy. The familiar dry, croaky voice of an ancient tribe whispered encouragement into my ear.

I made my choice. The spirits of the monolith observed my judgement.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_1	{Spiders}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_1	{I felt faint, as if my mind were being invaded. Pustules on my skin grew, bubbled and popped - and I felt countless tiny stabbing pin-pricks scrabbling from each gaping hole.
 
Suddenly metal spiders, perhaps tiny Sentinels, ran up my shoulder and into my visor. Could this be real? This could not be real. I started to scream.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Ancient Korvax consciousnesses watched my response, as though the encounter had been their experiment. The hallucination faded.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_2	{Tetrahedrons}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_2	{Tiny floating tetrahedrons emerged from the planet's surface and surrounded me. I tried to wave them away with my Multi-Tool, but each time they only swarmed closer to it - as if attracted to it somehow.

I raised my Multi-Tool, and they shimmered blue as they darted this way and that. Closer and closer.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

They were within touching distance of my Multi-Tool. They made one final surge, and I had a vision of a bright blue glow. Reality was restored.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_8	{Memories}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_8	{Blue light poured from the monolith as if a curtain had been dropped within. I heard a gentle hubbub of voices, and caught a familiar smell on the breeze. I could not remember my home, but I knew that this doorway led there.

I ached for a past I could not remember. Every inch of my soul wanted to make the leap back. I looked to the skies, and the infinity beyond. Could I truly abandon my journey, when it had only just begun?

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The spirits that lived in this place watched, noting which way I chose to step.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_13	{Child}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_13	{A child emerged from the monolith. It took a few moments before I realised that... it was me. I looked carefree and innocent. The little one stared up at my Exosuit, and tried to see me through my visor.

The child suddenly started to weep, and clung to my knees. They implored me never to leave. They didn't want to be alone. I should stay here forever. We should be reunited. Whole again once more.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

It felt strange, interacting with my child self. The Korvax Echoes watched on.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_3	{Sleep}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_3	{I began to feel dizzy. A strange lethargy came over me, and I felt compelled to lie down in front of the ancient relic. This place felt calming. It felt like home, wherever that might have once been.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I knew that if I truly wanted to fight the impulse to sleep I probably could, but I felt warm and comfortable basking in the glow of the ancient runes. I had to choose whether to trust the monolith, whether to relinquish control.

Ancient Korvax noted my choice.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_4	{Doppelganger}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_4	{A flickering reflection of my own body emerged from a portal. It mimicked every move I made. When I waved, it waved. When I raised my Multi-Tool, it copied instantly. The doppelganger made a motion to suggest it wanted something, and we both recoiled when I realised I had instinctively matched its movements.

Its body shimmered, but its equipment looked somehow real. Its Multi-Tool looked better than my own. The dimensional irregularity was fading....

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

After one final exchange, the mirror-me faded away.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_12	{Language}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_12	{A liquid metal lasso emerged and wrapped itself around my helmet. It froze in place, before pulling my head into contact with the glow of the monolith.

The ancient stone was warm, and deep inside I heard the hum of an arcane technology as it prepared to unleash itself. I looked up back up to the glyphs to try to guess why this might be happening. They talked to me in an alien tongue.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The strange metal connector released me, and I was gifted a small reward.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_16	{Future}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_16	{My movements seemed normal, but everything else was running faster than it should. The sun span around this globe in seconds, days endlessly turning to night and back again. The creatures that grazed and hunted around the site passed by in a blur.

I was trapped in a time vortex. Numbers on my Multi-Tool seemed to tick higher and higher. The closer I got to the Monolith, the more disturbance was added to the timeline...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I acted, and time resumed a normal rhythm.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_5	{Coins}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_5	{For many ages it appeared that pilgrims had carved numerical figures between the glowing glyphs of the monolith. Looking down, I noticed an ancient coin. I scraped the ground with my boot, and unearthed several more.

The site was otherwise silent. Perhaps it was eternally unresponsive, or perhaps it waited for something.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The Echoes that dwelled here awoke to observe my actions.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_6	{Blue Energy}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_6	{As I studied the ancient runes, they began to glow with an ethereal light. I could see wisps of a strange blue energy being pulled from the obelisk and swirling around my Multi-Tool.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

If I pulled the trigger, the exhaust would automatically open - allowing this strange ethereal substance into the body of my equipment. I made my choice, and the blue energy responded.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_17	{Protection}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_17	{I felt I was being watched. I turned, but could not see the potential assailant. But I knew, with burning certainty, that they were there. Somewhere out there on the alien landscape, someone was about to launch an attack.

Suddenly, the words of an unknown power blazed brightly on the monolith.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

My instincts were validated; a distant attack was fired. The Echoes observed my actions, and offered protection accordingly.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_7	{Pool}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_7	{An expanding pool of liquid metal had rippled out of the obelisk's base. My feet had already been covered. In the bright reflection I saw my expression turn to horror as I began to sink.

I felt warming hands on my legs, pulling me down into the silver sheet. Every hazard detection device on my Multi-Tool was going haywire...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I emerged from the metal pool, not quite understanding its nature.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_9	{Slavery}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_9	{Two stone blocks slowly revolved on the base of the monolith. Two beads of red light then traced images on each one. The red lights then pooled together and liquefied in an indentation below. The closer I got, the more agitated the red pool became.

The images both showed masked electronic lifeforms. The first showed the lifeform absorbing power to break free from its shackles. The second showed it hiding from its captors.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The red liquid surged into my equipment. It materialised into a technology blueprint.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_10	{Gift}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_10	{A chiselled hole appeared at the foot of the obelisk. From its smoothed edges and the scraped markings around it, it was clear that over centuries unknown creatures had pushed elements through this gap.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

It was impossible to tell quite what would happen, but below it were three blocks of the exact same dimensions that looked like they could be turned by a mechanism deep within the monolith itself.

I searched my pack for elements that looked like they could fit, and inserted them into the hole. The monolith accepted my offering, transforming it into something greater.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_11	{Orb}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_11	{The Monolith disappeared. The landscape around me seemed the same, but somehow the planetary vegetation had moved. Sitting central to where the mysterious stone once stood was a red glowing orb.

The intensity of the orb burned the ground beneath it. It crackled with an unknown power. I felt compelled to pick it up, and become a part of it. A distant voice spoke to me...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The red orb judged me. Reality was restored.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_14	{Casing}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_14	{An empty shell of an electronic lifeform emerged from the monolith. It was ancient and weather-beaten. The light in its mask had been extinguished for many centuries.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

It held a rusted canister in its hand, which my scanner detected had once contained refined metal. The scan also revealed an unknown substance deep within the defunct entity's casing.

The ancient Korvax judged my actions before the casing was absorbed back into the monolith.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_15	{Corruption}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_15	{The inside of the planet was hollow, and I was standing at the base of its vast bowl. Around me the roots of trees pushed upwards from uncovered alien soil.

I looked down, and saw the foundations of the Monolith raised at my feet. Crystalline veins of different elements pulsated through the exposed rock. I heard a lifeform screaming in binary.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I extracted elements from the rock, and the inversion ended.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_18	{Alignment}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_18	{Stars had aligned above the monolith. In the heavens above, two distinct lines of distant suns could be seen stretching out into the depths of space. To be here at this exact moment in time, when the moving parts of the galaxy were aligned so perfectly, seemed almost an impossibility.

I was filled with a strange calm. One line of stars pointed towards the glow of a dull red giant, the other an unseen point far, far beyond my vision.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I chose one of the trajectories, Korvax echoes taking note.}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_TITLE_19	{Toxins}
UI_PORTAL_EXP_MONO_19	{I felt faint. Ill, even. Looking around, the vegetation that surrounded this ancient structure looked withered and sickly. The creatures of the planet, meanwhile, appeared to keep their distance.

As I stared, a warning etched itself into the stone, the words of an ancient language...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Environmental warning sensors in my Exosuit were behaving erratically. The suit was fighting against a powerful force, but was stronger than I had anticipated. My Hazard Protection system went into override. The vision ended, and I left unharmed.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_11	{Molten Rock}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_11	{I placed my palm on the monolith, then stood back when it melted in response to my touch. Molten rock dripped down the stone, exposing a hollow interior.

Inside, I saw riches that were beyond belief. Ancient technologies and cargo that would aid my journey. Suddenly, the voice of an ancient tribe shook the ground I stood on...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Lava continued to drop, and the edifice seemed unstable, but equipment that could aid me was within arm's reach.

The ancient warriors who once worshipped here passed judgement upon my actions.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_1	{Crystal Ice}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_1	{I felt a strange chill. A layer of frozen gas suddenly coated the monolith from bottom to top. It was so cold that I could see my breath inside my helmet.

There was one small gap in the crystal ice, and I felt convinced that I could feed some of my mined elements through it, so they could come into contact with the monolith behind.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I chose an element to insert, and was rewarded accordingly.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_12	{Ancient Scripts}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_12	{There were three vast columns of words on the ancient structure, each written in a different alphabet.

The first column's words were like savage runes scratched in sand, the second showed precise sequences of dots. The final column had wide and welcoming letters, almost appearing hand-written in hard stone.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The dirt and blood of ancient hand prints covered the base of each column.

I pressed my hand against the writing, and the ancient spirits that dwelled here infused me with the language of their descendants.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_2	{A Violent End}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_2	{The body of a warrior emerged from the obelisk, a jagged tear in their midriff suggesting their end was not a peaceful one. They still held their Multi-Tool.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The surface of the sculpted rock blurred and showed images of military worship. It was trying to tell me something.

The ancients closely observed my treatment of the warrior's remains.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_3	{The Hunt}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_3	{A small terrified creature emerged from the monolith and ran between my legs. I heard the noises of an ancient hunt: the howls of pack animals in pursuit and the thunder of hooves. 

Warriors on vast beasts charged through the rock, and amidst the chaos one saw me staring. It raised its facial tendrils in greeting, barked a few words and swung a bladed weapon down towards me.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The hallucination faded, and the Vy'keen ancients passed judgement upon my courage.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_13	{Withered Remains}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_13	{I became a part of a strange new reality. The ancient rock opened. Inside, the dried out heart of an ancient warrior was strung up between wooden pillars. It pulsed slowly as it hung there, still beating.

Lying below it on a dusty floor were a set of wrinkled lungs that looked forever doomed to wheeze stale air. A desiccated eyeball stared up at me. Unblinking.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I treated the grim remains as felt appropriate, and the monolith responded dramatically.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_4	{Woodland Creature}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_4	{The monolith showed images of creatures lying dead before it. Each sacrificed, butchered and offered up to whatever Gods were once worshipped here.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Suddenly, the head of a small woodland animal raised up through the earth below me. It stared at me with wide-eyes, then gave a joyful skip when its tiny hooves reached ground level. Something was clearly expected of me...

I acted the only way I could, and the Vy'keen ancients watched closely.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_20	{Death}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_20	{I was suddenly underwater. I was drowning. Water clogged my lungs. My chest was on fire. I gasped for air where there was none, and felt only tepid liquids filling me inside and out. My vision was clouding. I knew this was my time. This was it. This was what it felt like.

Suddenly, a green hand thrust itself through the surface of the water. The light was fading...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Reality reverted. Perhaps this was how I would face death when it finally, truly, came for me.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_5	{Red and Yellow}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_5	{Two ancient stone cups materialised in front of the monolith. One was filled with a dark red viscous liquid, the other contained a sticky fluid that was bright yellow and smelled powerfully bitter.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

On the stone tablet behind the cups, ancient glyphs swirled to form an image. A powerful and muscular warrior surrounded by a red halo challenged an opponent clad in bright yellow armour.

I chose a liquid, and drank. It tasted foul, choking me, flowing freely from my mouth.

The vision faded, and the liquid crystallised into nanite clusters.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_6	{Web}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_6	{The monolith ripped like paper, opening a window to another world. It was laced with a giant web. Just within my reach, an ancient warrior lay cocooned.

They had been there for centuries. Dead, vacant eyes stared through me and on into the landscape beyond. Suddenly, I heard a voice call out.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The body carried a rusted Multi-Tool, while a bulging growth on its chest suggested it might contain greater riches. Suddenly, the leathery growth started to move...

I attempted to salvage what I could. The voice on the wind laughed...}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_14	{Coliseum}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_14	{I was inside a vast coliseum and beneath a blood red sky. The noise was overpowering. Warriors screamed and barked at the battle set up before them.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Two combatants were squaring up on the crimson sand. One had lost their blade, and hid behind a shield. The other stalked towards them, with a spear raised.

I felt compelled to add my voice to the howl of the mob. My favoured gladiator fatally wounded their rival, and bowed towards me.

As the vision faded, I was thanked with something to assist me in combat.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_15	{Leak}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_15	{I felt an intense heat burning within the rock. Suddenly, as if attracted to my suit, a liquid metal started to seep from a hole that had been broken into the rock. A voice screamed out.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

What started as a drip became a surge forcing itself through the gap. The monolith's previous contents were draining, and its glow was starting to fade.

I acted quickly, and the vision ended.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_7	{Crimson Eyes}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_7	{A portal opened on the monolith, and the body of a huge winged animal fell to my feet. Its throat had been ritually cut, and its wings had been tattooed with faces of an ancient warrior tribe. The eyes though, the eyes looked strange...

Its original eyes had been cut out, and replaced by glittering red orbs. The more I looked, the more they blazed. An advanced technology clearly lay at their centre. Could I bear to desecrate this sacrifice for help with my journey?

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I made my decision carefully, and the ancients that dwelled here noted my choice. I was bathed in crimson light, nanites spilling forth into my hands.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_8	{The Hound's Offering}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_8	{The giant mouth of an ancient hound suddenly emerged through the face of the monolith. It opened its jaws wide, and foul-smelling spittle streaked my visor. My nausea was tempered by the sight of valuable commodities balanced on its giant tongue.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

In a sudden movement the hound shifted the goods to one side of its mouth, spraying saliva over my arms. There was space on the tongue for more, should I wish to give up some of my cargo.

I weighed up my choice, and the vision faded.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_9	{Blade}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_9	{An ancient warrior's feet and legs slowly emerged from the bottom of the monolith. The rest of their torso then followed, unceremoniously pushed out onto the bare rock. They had been decapitated.

Blood dripped at my feet. High above me a disembodied head laughed at my shock. It shouted a guttural command of encouragement.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

Behind, I heard an ancient blade unsheathe, and someone rushing towards me...

It was a test; the blade was only spectral. The vision faded.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_10	{Insignificance}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_10	{The monolith fragmented before my eyes. It folded down in on itself, again and again, until it was a tiny red orb surrounded by dancing lights.

It felt like something truly ancient, perhaps something divine, was showing me the origin of these strange constructions.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The metal I carried was physically dragging me towards it - desperate to help it rebuild. The elements I carried wanted to offer themselves; I surrendered them to the structure. I felt a rush of blood. My head span. I was without myself, and witnessed my true place within the infinite bounds of space.

The monolith slowly rebuilt, inch by inch. It pitied me my insignificance.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_16	{Blob}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_16	{The body of a gilled blob creature materialised on the surface of the rock. It was an ancient sacrifice, impaled through its wide, open eyes with metal spears.

Liquid was dripping from the body, down the monolith, through a channel cut into the rock by ancient hands. It could be diverted toward two carvings – one of a sun, the other of a moon.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The ancients observed my interference. The vision shifted, then concluded.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_17	{Consumed}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_17	{I felt drained. Readings on my Multi-Tool and Exosuit started to gradually pull downwards, and a feeling of lethargy overwhelmed me. I breathed normally, but my body screamed for oxygen.

A thought from outside my own mind started to echo through my consciousness.

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

The life-draining monolith, silent and unmoving, towered above. I did what I felt was wise, and survived the encounter.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_18	{The Treasure of Nal}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_18	{A beam of light shone down from the sky, and was focused by ancient glyphs onto a stone surface marked with ancient carvings.

The beam slowly traced towards images scratched into the stone. A vast warrior battle, an alien city, and what could be a stolen treasure. The hand prints of pilgrims covered each one...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I touched an image. The vision changed, followed by silence.}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_TITLE_19	{Energy}
UI_PORTAL_WAR_MONO_19	{A sudden pulse of destructive energy flowed through my Exosuit. My Multi-Tool sensed another build-up of energy growing deep within the monolith. It would soon unleash itself on me, and the landscape that surrounded the ancient site.

I could use my Exosuit's shielding to dampen the imminent energy wave, but the suit's systems were too overwhelmed to identify the hazard...

<STORY_HIGH>"%ALIEN_TEXT%"<>

I listened to the voice, and braced against the wave as best I could.}
